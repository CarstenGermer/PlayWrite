# Script for a simple testrace in the Lone-Lands,
# starting at the Forsaken Inn to the summit of Weathertop and back.
# First marshal at the inn, reacting to "station start" and recording starting time.
# Second marshal at the summit of Weathertop, reacting to "station gipfel" and recording that time,
# therefore effectively having proof the contestant acutally was at the summit.
# Third marshal back at the inn, reacting to "station ziel" and recording the time at the finish.
# Afterwards look at the lists, check if everyone was at the summit, subtract the starting times
# from the finish times and you got the time every contestant needed to seconds.
# If you prefer to start your contestants at the same time with "3 .. 2 .. 1 .. GO!" you don't
# need the first marshal. Check if everyone was at the summit and compare the finish times.
# For longer races with many contestants it's advisable to prepare a spreadsheet to import all
# exported lists from all marshals, check for missed stations and calculate times automatically.
